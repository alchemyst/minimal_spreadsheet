# Introduction

This code contains some experiments in creating a minimal spreadsheet-like GUI in Python.

I discuss the ideas behind the "Original" version of the code in [this blog bost](http://negfeedback.blogspot.co.za/2017/12/a-simple-gui-spreadsheet-in-less-than.html)

A link to that blog post was also posted to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7klkzi/a_simple_gui_spreadsheet_in_less_than_100_lines/).

Shortly after the original tkinter version, I also developed a PyQt5 version and created this repository to retain future code changes.

# To Do

- [X] PyQt5 version
- [ ] Extract calculation logic to common class
- [ ] Replace `eval` with something less dangerous
